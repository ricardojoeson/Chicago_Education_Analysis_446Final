Author: Zhouxiang Sun Date: December 2025 Course: PA 446 - Coding for Civic Data Applications (Fall 2025)

Project Overview 
This project investigates the structural relationship between neighborhood socioeconomic status and educational outcomes in Chicago Public Schools (CPS). By integrating school performance metrics with community-level census data, this analysis aims to move beyond simple school rankings to identify the root causes of educational inequality.

Key components of the analysis include:

Data Acquisition: Automated data ingestion from the Chicago Data Portal API.

Spatial Analysis: Interactive mapping of school performance against community wealth, poverty, and safety metrics.

Machine Learning: Using Decision Trees and XGBoost to identify the primary drivers of college enrollment rates and to impute missing data.

Automation: A parameterized reporting workflow to generate individual profiles for Chicago's 77 community areas.
